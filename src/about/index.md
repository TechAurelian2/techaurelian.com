title: About TechAurelian
---

This is the home of a few Hello World programs and apps created by TechAurelian in his spare time.

(Hello World apps are pretty famous, even if all they usually do is write "Hello, World!" on the screen. Starting with such a simple program has become a tradition when learning a new programming language or platform.)

TechAurelian is passionate about technology and Hello World programs (a.k.a. learning new things).
