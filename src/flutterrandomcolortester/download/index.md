You can run the Flutter Random Color Tester web app in your browser on Android, ChromeOS, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, and more.

Flutter Random Color Tester is also a Progressive Web App (PWA). You can easily and conveniently "install" it on your device so you can access it in the same way you would any other installed app.
