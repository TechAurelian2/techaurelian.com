## Overview

A basic Flutter project that tests the [flutter_randomcolor](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_randomcolor){target=_blank} Dart package for generating attractive random colors.

flutter_randomcolor is a Dart port of David Merfield's [randomColor](https://github.com/davidmerfield/randomColor){target=_blank} JavaScript utility.

Flutter Random Color Tester is actually a Flutter web app that you can run in your browser to generate dozens or hundreds of attractive random colors. You can select options to influence the type of color it produces and copy the generated colors to the clipboard for reuse in other apps or places.

Just open [https://frctester.techaurelian.com](https://frctester.techaurelian.com){target=_blank} in your browser to give it a try.

## Open Source

Flutter Random Color Tester is free and doesn't contain any advertisements. It contains no permissions, either, so you don't have to worry about your privacy being compromised.

It's also open source. The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechAurelian/flutter_random_color_tester){target=_blank} and licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/TechAurelian/flutter_random_color_tester/blob/main/LICENSE){target=_blank}. I look forward to your feedback or contributions!
