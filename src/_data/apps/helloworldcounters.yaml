title: Hello World Counters
description: "My first Hello World Flutter app is an easy-to-use tally counter app with multiple color counters. Count people, sheep, kisses, or smiles, and nobody will know what you are counting! You can increase, decrease, and reset the counter, or share it via email, messenger, or social media."
