## Overview {.mt-0}

Slate Blue. Crimson. Peach Puff. A beautiful color with a beautiful name with every shuffle! A free and open-source "Hello, World!" app made with Flutter.

## Hello World

I'm learning Flutter, and this is one of my first Hello World Flutter apps.

Hello World apps are pretty famous, even if all they usually do is write "Hello, World!" on the screen. Starting with such a simple program has become a tradition when learning a new programming language or platform.

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/){target=_blank} is a UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Open Source

Hello World Colors is free and doesn't contain any advertisements. It contains no permissions, either, so you don't have to worry about your privacy being compromised.

It's also open source. The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechAurelian/hello_world_colors){target=_blank} and licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/TechAurelian/hello_world_colors/blob/main/LICENSE){target=_blank}. I look forward to your feedback or contributions!
