{# Based on https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com/ #}

TechAurelian built the software application Hello World Counters ("App") as an Open Source app. The App is provided by TechAurelian at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use the App.

If you choose to use the App, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

The App does not collect any personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number, fax number, or email address).

## Log Data

The App does not collect any log data.

## Third Party Services

The App does not use any third party services.

## Sharing of application data

All application data (that is the data you created with the App) is only stored locally on your devices. This data is never shared with any other services or people unless you explicitly choose to do so through the sharing options available.

## Permissions Required

The pp does not request any permissions.

## Security

I value your trust in providing me your Personal Information, thus I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Sites

The App may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Children's Privacy

I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. I encourage all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the App and/or website. I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the App and/or website without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to me through the App and/or website, please contact me. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries I may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2022-11-09
