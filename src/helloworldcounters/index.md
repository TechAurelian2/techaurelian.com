## Overview

Hello World Counters is an easy-to-use tally counter app for Android. It gives you a different counter for each of the unambiguous color terms in English: White, Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Brown, Purple, Pink, Orange, and Grey. This means you can count people, sheep, kisses, or smiles, and nobody will know what you are counting! (And if you do get caught, just tell them that it's a game.)

You can increment or decrement the counter, reset its value back to zero, or share it by email, messenger apps, or social networks. Hello World Counters are a great way to pass the time when you are bored, or just need something simple and fun to do.

### Count anything

Counting is one of the most important things to do in any business or personal life. We use it for many reasons: for keeping track of tasks; for measuring results and progress; or simply because we think it's fun.

Hello World Counters can be used to count anything you want! Each counter has a different background color to help you separate the counters in your mind. You can use it to count how many times people laugh at your jokes, how many times you have sneezed in a day, or how many cups of coffee you drink every morning. You can also count birds, trees, or stars, and nobody will know what you are counting! (You can even count your friends and family members, but remember not to let them know what you're doing.)

The Hello World Counters are simple, clean, and perfect for everyone.

## Hello World

Hello World Counters is a simple app that does one thing and does it well: counts the number of times you say "Hello World." The app is simple to use: just tap the screen each time you say Hello World.

Really?

No, actually I'm learning Flutter, and this is my first Hello World Flutter app.

Hello World apps are pretty famous, even if all they usually do is write "Hello, World!" on the screen. Starting with such a simple program has become a tradition when learning a new programming language or platform.

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Open Source

Hello World Counters is free and doesn't contain any advertisements. It contains no permissions, either, so you don't have to worry about your privacy being compromised.

It's also open source. The project is hosted on GitHub and licensed under the MIT license. I look forward to your feedback or contributions!
